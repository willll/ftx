# cppcheck configuration for Google C++ Style
# Place this file as .cppcheck in your project root

# Enable all checks, including style
enable=all

# Suppressions for third-party or generated code (edit as needed)
suppress=missingIncludeSystem


# Google C++ style guideline (partial support)
# Note: cppcheck does not natively enforce Google style, but '--library=google' enables some checks if the google.cfg file is available.
# If you do not have google.cfg, omit '--library=google'.
#
# Recommended usage (from project root, after building with CMake):
#   cppcheck --enable=all --project=build/compile_commands.json
# Or, if you have google.cfg:
#   cppcheck --library=google --enable=all --project=build/compile_commands.json


# Exclude build and external directories
-i build
-i external

# Set language standard
std=c++17

# Additional options can be set via command line or here
